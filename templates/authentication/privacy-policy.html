          <p>HOW DO WE USE THIS INFORMATION?</p>

          <p>We will only use personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in
            the following circumstances:</p>

          <p>• Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and your interests and fundamental rights do not
            override those interests.</p>

          <p>Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data.</p>

          <p>MARKETING</p>

          <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing
            and advertising. We may use your contact details and technical data that we collect about you, such as your
            IP address and the way you browse our website to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what
            may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you
            (we call this marketing). You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested
            information from us or if you provided us with your details when you requested a quote and in each case, you
            have not opted out of receiving that marketing. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any
            time by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.

            as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other

          <p>REMARKETING AND BEHAVIOURAL TARGETING</p>

          <p>We use Google Adwords and Bing Ads to provide targeted adverts to consumers who may wish to use our

            advertising, protect against fraud and abuse, and personalise content and ads you see on Google. You can

            the information collected by Google.You can visit Bing’s privacy policy here to find out more about how Bing
            Ads work and how you can control the information collected by Bing.</p>

            targeting, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative website here.</p>

            marketing purposes.</p>

          <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably
            consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.
            If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the
            legal basis, which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your
            knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

          <p>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

          <p>You acknowledge and agree that from time to time we have the right to share your personal information with:

            data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>

          <p>• If Billntrade Ltd or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case
            personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.</p>

          <p>• If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal
            obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to

            exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and
            credit risk reduction.</p>

          <p>WHERE DO WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

          <p>All personal data we process is processed by our staff and contractors who are based both in the UK and
            outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

          <p>For the purposes of IT hosting and maintenance this information is located on servers within the European
            Economic Area.</p>

          <p>Some of our external third parties such as Google are based in US, outside the European Economic Area (EEA)
            so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. We also have
            developers who are based in countries outside the EEA who may have access to your personal data as part of
            their activities for our business. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
            similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is
            implemented:</p>

          <p>• Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European
            Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
            <p>• If they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal
              data, shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy
              Shield.</p>

            <p>Once we have received your information, we have a Data Protection regime in place to oversee the
              effective and secure processing of your personal data and we will use strict procedures and security
              features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

            <p>However and unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.
              Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
              transmitted to our website at transmission stage; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>

            <p>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION FOR?</p>

            <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it
              for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
              sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
              personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those
              purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. We are required under UK tax law to
              keep basic personal data about our customers (name, address, contact details) for a minimum of 6 years
              after which time it will be destroyed. In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that
              it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use
              this information indefinitely without further notice to you. In some circumstances you can ask us to
              delete your data. See below for further information.</p>

            <p>WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?</p>

            <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal
              data:</p>

            <p>• Request access to your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Request correction of your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Request erasure of your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Object to processing of your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Request restriction of processing your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Request transfer of your personal data.</p>

            <p>• Right to withdraw consent.</p>

            <p>EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS</p>

            <p>If you wish to exercise any of your rights set out above, please use the contact us form. We try to
              respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if
              your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify
              you and keep you updated. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any
              of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,
              repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
            </p>
