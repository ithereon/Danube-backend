                        <h3>What type of plumbing services can I expect from a local plumbing company</h3>

                        <h4>Before you hire a plumber, you need to figure out the specific plumbing services that you require from them.</h4>

                        <h4> - Is it a drain problem?</h4>
                        <h4> - Is it a waste flow pipe leakage, broken cistern or toilet?</h4>
                        <h4> - Is it low water pressure? frozen piping, or no hot water?</h4>

                        <h4>Understand the problem is the first step before moving to your search for a plumber. Failing to identify the problem, means, the services you need may 
                            allow deceitful plumbing contractors to offer unnecessary plumbing services and charge you extra.

                        <h3><b>Leak repair services that plumbers can help with</b></h3>

                        <h4>Leak examples</h4>

                        <h4>Is your bathtub or shower leaking? If so, the leak could be caused by a burst pipe. Continuous leaking may end up increasing your water bill due to the amount of water lost in the leak. 
                        Perhaps you have a swimming pool that has a pinhole sized leak. Do you know that a pinhole sized leak in your home can waste up to 970 gallons of water daily! Some of the characteristics of 
                        pool leakage to look out for include algae formation after treating the pool, cracked pool shells and loose tiles. Worst of all if you have a leak under the bath, it could end up damaging the
                        floor and ceiling of your home, or if you live in a flat, could leak and soak through to the neighbours below. Correcting this 
                        can be costly, if there are structural integrity issues, or rot, but equally it can be a case of dehumidification of 
                        the room after repair, either way you want to identify this as soon as possible and get it looked into and repaired.</h4>

                        <h4>Maybe the toilet is leaking. If this sound familiar and you are experiencing any problems to do wih water leaks, turn off the mains water valve in your home, 
                        then contact the relevant plumbing services, they will be of great help in not just prevention, but fixing the issue, and potentially saving you additional costs such as water damage through 
                        flooding, and the repair work to restore the area that can also be expensive, so this needs to be considered as a matter of both urgent resolve and cost management.</h4>

                        <h4>It could be just be a seal or gasket needs replacing or it could be corrosive damage, resulting in conyaminated water or a burst pipe. The repair can require new plumbing and instalation of equipment,
                        so it is important to find a plumber in your area that specializes in these types of leaks and repairs.</h4>
                        
                        <h4>Once you found several plumbers, ask them to inspect, quote and gurantee they can fix the leak, before choosing one.</h4>

                        <h4>If you need a shower unit installed and plumbed, a plumber can help here. If your shower does not deliver hot water, or the boiler unit 
                        is not heating up the water (possibly due to heating elements being damaged) you may need new ones, or a new modern boiler. You need to get a licensed and registered plumber to look at the problem, 
                        and work on the repair. If there is no water coming out of the shower, this could be a result of some type of blockage within the shower pipes, 
                        and the plumber will need to determine this and how to clear the blockage.</h4>
    
                        <h4>Does your shower produce screeching or yelling sounds inside the pipe anytime you use it? The sound could be caused by sediments built 
                        up within the pipes and may require deep cleaning and sometimes replacement of the pipes. Additionally, it could be that there is cold water,
                        but no hot in which case check it is not linked to a local outage due to work or damage in the area, before contacting a plimber</h4>

                        <h4>Most plumbing professional services have the skills, equipment, and experience to handle shower repairs, having been apprentices and been technically, engineering and on the job trained,
                        this will be the case for specific CORGI standards in repairs, both electrical or plumbing. They would have invested many hours as well as, money to study and take and pass exams.
                        To get qualified can be incredibly difficlut and requires dedication and focus by the apprentcie. Before you find a plumber in your local area, ensure they are qualified, and have worked on several 
                        shower repair projects in the past. Additionally, you want to work with someone who has experience in dealing with the different shower systems.</h4>

                        <h4><b><p style="color:red;">Pick a referral website that does not charge per RFQ.</p></b></h4>

                        <h4><b>Removal of trapped air or air bubbles in the plumbing apparatus</b></h4>

                        <h4>Have you noticed that water is not flowing from the taps in your home? just to give some context, Lack of water flow may be caused by the formation of airlocks within the pipes. 
                        The trapped air prevents the normal flow of water in the pipes, making it difficult to use the bathroom sinks, kitchen sinks and even the hot showers.
                        These dependent systems in the infrastructure can all be affected by single or multiple air bubbles in the piping.</h4>

                        <h4>Professional licensed plumbers can release the trapped air from your drainage system, there is no simple way to tell whether the lack of water in the taps is a result of airlocks or 
                        blocked pipes, but the good thing is a plumber is best placed with the tools and training, to determine the cause. At billntrade, we recommend you get in touch with plumbing services for an inspection first, before 
                        moving to quote and spend on work, after all, you want to pay for the right job first time, not solving by process of illimination.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Services for unblocking the drainage by a plumber</b></h4>

                        <h4>The majority of plumbing companies in the UK offer services to unblock the drains or drainage systems. Blocked drains can cause big problems in areas of the kitchen and bathroom, 
                        this could include secondary issues such as foul smells, mould, bacteria and other hygiene related problems. This is something that you don't want, for both the safety and health of your family or people residing in the 
                        home. To encure no futher problems are caused care should be taken dispensing of most tissues in the toilet basin, as some materials may not be biodegradable, also in large clumps can block 
                        the piping. Good news is with technology and advancements in current materials properties and densities, structures, thickness, biodegradability etc, means more products are permeable to water flow and can be 
                        flushed down the toilet, however, care should be taken when considering flushing toiletry products, wipes, etc down the toilet.
                        By not doing this, you can save getting build up of tissue and blockages in the piping because the products.</h4>

                        <h4>They may block the drainage or the waste water systems, making it difficult to complete the flush cycle in the toilet, this means water does not flow down the ubend, but instead 
                            can back up and cause rising toilet water or waste retention. You should read the correct disposal instructions on the packaging before flushing anything down the toilet.</h4>              

                        <h4>Flushing food debris down the kitchen sink can allows cause the drainage to block, making it difficult to wash dishes in the sink. Food should be captured in a drain capture unit, and disposed of
                        in the bin. By allowing waste to flow doen the sink, you could cause build up in the u-bend, or cause water pressure differences at points in the pipe due to blockage. 
                        These pressure blockages in the plumbing system in your home can cause them to burst in extreme situations. Burst pipes also cause the waste in the pipes to back up and come out of the toilet bowl or the kitchen sink. 
                        If you have witnessed any of the above in your home, you need to hire a plumber immediately to fix the drains, and cease the activity that has caused it,</h4>

                        <h4><b>Costs for drainage unblocking</b></h4>

                        <h4>The cost of unblocking a drain is a combination of the call-out charge and the work they need to do. The Type of job will have an average cost call out i.e.

                        <h4>One of the signs that your home may be in desperate need of plumbing services, is strange smells around the house or in specific piping areas. Finding the source of strange smell caused by plumbing issues 
                        may be difficult since the odor may come from within the pipes.</h4>

                        <h4>Plumbing companies provide odor detection tests. The tests involve the use of smoke or electronic devices to test or trace the source of the odor. Strange odors in your home may pose a safety risk to your home. We recommend you call in a 
                        plumbing contractor immediately to detect the source of any strange odors in your home.</h4>
                            
                        <h4><b>How is smoke drain testing done by a plumber?</b></h4>

                        <h4>1. Firstly the plumber needs the right tools, equipment and resources as well as knowledge of drainage systems</h4>

                        <h4>2. They then locate the main drain line, where the waste pipe exits the property, a ballon is inserted and air inflated 
                            past the sweep, to block the drainage system. The main water stop cock must be turned off and no water allowed to flow.</h4>

                        <h4>3. The roof is accessed (or the attic) and smoke is introduced. Wherever the smell is coming from, it is best to start 
                            in this area, as this is most likely the source, although there may be additional sources.</h4>

                        <h4>4. The plumber will look for the smoke beginning to rise from vents, and block these off with duct tape as appropraite</h4>

                        <h4>5. The plumber will inspect the attic under crawl spaces and between beams.</h4>

                        <h4>6. The plumber will be inspecting for breaches and once identified will mark the area in question and remove any cladding 
                            to access the breach.</h4>

                        <h4>7. The plumber can then inspect and make the necessary repairs</h4>

                        <h4>The whole process can take upto several hours, and depending on the drainage system, accessability, size of property etc.
                        you can expect to pay between £500 and £4000 pounds for the whole job, but many factors affect the price, some of which we 
                        have mentioned above.</h4>

                        <h3>Sewer line replacement services</h3>

                        <h4>When we flush water down the drain, we assume it goes straight to the sewer system and disappears. However, if the sewer line for the home breaks or clogs, 
                        dirty water finds its way back into your home again. Old age and tree roots creeping into the piping network, may cause the sewer pipes to get damaged and break as the growth will continue unabated.
                        Plumbing contractors provide sewer line repair and replacement services. If your sewer line is broken, 
                        we recommend you hire a plumber to fix it to improve the sanitisation of the water flowing into your home.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Costs and what is involved in sewer line replacement?</b></h4>

                        <h4>A camera line inspection is a pre-requisite in any sewer line inspection and can identify faults using visual and digital imagery.
                        This can be to inspect what the plumber can't see, or to confirm what the plumber suspects, either way, the objective is inspection,
                        through techno;ogy, visual analysis, inspection and identification of the root problem and/or secondary problems. Confirming potential causes is also 
                        part of the process, all this adds to the costs, and onc can budegt for between £200 and £600, for the inspection, but again, this  will depend on a number of factors, 
                        such as access, location, time, disruption etc.</h4>

                        <h4>The added benefit is that is the process is more surgical, this means that the plumber does not need to dig up the entire piping foundation before finding the problem, 
                        but rather, can use a less intrusive and specialised equipment and method to pin-point the problem area, and focus on digging there and rectifying the problem at source. 
                        This is cheaper than digging up an entire drainage or sewer line location, as well as the work to repair and replace, clean up and restore the area.</h4>
    
                        <h4>In the event that it is highly localised damage, the plumber can quote for the cheapest and most effective way to repair the damage
                        through the use of a camera. This is also less disruptive, distressing and costly for the homeowner.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Piping replacement costs</b></h4>

                        <h4>You should budget around £200 to £500 per square foot of piping replaced, in the event of a problem found, the more piping the higher the cost.
                        There are different types of piping materials, that can be used and your plumber can advise you of what to use and where.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Traditional vs. Trenchless replacment</b></h4>

                        <h4><b>Traditional</b></h4>

                        <h4>If work needs doing, the two most common approaches are traditional or trenchless. Traditional costs around, £100 to £200 per foot and involves
                        digging up the old piping and replacing it with a new one. This is costly as it requires a lot of digging, equiplemnt, removal of earth and aggregate, as well as 
                        clean up and restoration costs.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Trenchless</b></h4>

                        <h4>Is less invasive and requires the insertion of a pre-inflated tube, though a strategic access location, there are two methods.</h4>

                        <h4><b>1. Pipe Lining</b></h4>

                        <h4>Insertion of a pre-inflated tube, to the one in position, the pipe lining it is inflated as the tube hardens and creates a new secure piping infrastructure
                        at the location. This is common if the line isn't completely broken, but split, it is also possible to align it more accurately.</h4>
    
                        <h4><b>2.  Pipe Bursting</b></h4>
    
                        <h4>Insertion of a new pipe which is expanded, to cause the old pipe to burst, and the new pipe replaces the localised area, 
                        previously occupied by the destroyed pipe, followed by the application of sealing product to ensure no leakage and uniformity.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Landscaping and clean-up</b></h4>

                        <h4>These are sperate costs, so ensure you factor them in over and above the cost of the inspection and repair 
                            undertaken by the plumber.</h4>

                        <h3>Installation and repairs of backflow prevention</h3>

                        <h4>You are likely drinking and bathing with contaminated water if you haven't installed backflow preventers in your home. The backflow preventers system keeps the waste water from 
                        flowing back and contaminating clean water in the pipes. professional plumbers offer installation and repair services to fix the backflow system of a house, if it is compromised.</h4>

                        <h4>•	Incorrect faucet installation</h4>

                        <h3>Low water pressure</h3>

                        <h4>The low water pressure within the plumbing system can make it difficult to access water in the taps and affect shower pressure. 
                        Most times, low water pressure indicates an underlying problem in the plumbing system. 
                        Problems that may result in low water pressure include:</h4>

                        <h4>•	Corrosion of the water pipes</h4>

                        <h4>•	Cracked sewer lines</h4>
                        <h4>•	Clogged sewer line</h4>

                        <h4>If you notice that water pressure is an issue, ask your plumber to check the the sump pump, to enure it is not failing, 
                        a licensed plumber can come and check this for a reasonable call out charge, and most likely this will be low. This will be also
                        be a way for the plumber to secure the quote and order materials for the repair of the problem. Look at your options, if someone can inspect for free 
                        and offer to repair at a lower or more market driven cost, this may well be a better proposition, than spending hundreds on callout
                        fees. Remember, plumbing is a call out fee driven business, before diagnosis and reperation, so the better a plumber understands, how
                        to cost a job the more liekly they are to do a good job</h4>

                        <h4>Plumbers can spot underlying plumbing problems</h4>

                        <h4>The benefit of working with a skilled plumber is that they can notice additional problems within the plumbing system that you may have missed. For instance, if the water pressure in the house is too low, 
                        it could be caused by a broken sewer line or clogged drains.</h4>

                        <h4>Plumbers are experienced and skilled.</h4>

                        <h4>Instead of struggling with the plumbing issue in your home, hiring a plumber offers you a quick and easy solution. When you hire an experienced plumber, they will quickly fix the plumbing problem. Experienced plumbers understand 
                        how to handle the plumbing process from troubleshooting, materials, installations and repair.</h4>

                        <h3>Tips for getting in touch with a plumber</h3>

                        <h4>Asking the right questions</h4>

                        <h4>When you find several potential plumbers that offer the services you need, we recommend that you ask the plumbers the same questions, and analyze the answers they provide. 
                        Some of the best questions to ask a plumber in the UK include:</h4>

                        <h4>•	Have they done a similar project in the past?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Does the plumbing company specialize in both installation and repair services, or does it offer specific services?</h4>
                        <h4>•	What trade bodies do they belong to and can they demonstrate this?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Are they insured and what does their policy cover?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Do they offer warranty on parts and post work support, how long is this for?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Will the plumber offer a guarantee for the work they do in your home?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Does the plumber require a permit to offer plumbing services in your area?</h4>
                        <h4>•	How long will it take the plumber to complete the project or job?</h4>
                        <h4>•	In case the project takes more time and involves new costs, will the plumbing company notify me before hand</h4>

                        <h4>Again, this is not an exahustive list, but questions you should consider asking, why not think of questions that are also important for you?</h4>

                        <h3>How much does it cost to hire a plumber</h3>

                        <h4>The average cost of hiring a plumber (as a guide in 2022) is between £70 and £120 for each hour the plumber works. This plumbing fee excludes any costs 
                        related to transport and materials. When working with an affordable plumbing contractor, you can expect to pay about £50 for transport. 
                        If you are looking to work with an experienced, high-quality, professional plumber, you may pay about £200 per hour, plus costs.</h4>
