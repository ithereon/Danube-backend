                                <h3>1. Some positive news for building and home development projects</h3>

                                <h4>Research is something we at <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a> enjoy doing. Research helps us understand what is happening
                                in the trade space and helps us to share that with our customers and communities. One interesting piece of research
                                we found was a survey by Nationwide UK. The study indicated that many homeowners were able to make savings during
                                the
                                Covid-19 period. This was a result of the safety measure put in place by governments and employers, to keep people safe, and 
                                prevent the spread.
                                These measures were about prioritising safety, starting with employees and their families. By introducing a regional and 
                                a national lockdown experiment, rapid control of the spread of covid, was established. The goal was to significantly and at scale, reduce the risk and rate of infections, transmissions and 
                                evolution the C-19 virus, This saved countless lives, by enabling emergency services and the NHS to increase on patient care, while reducing competing needs 
                                for their services, in other areas, associated with a non-lockdown arrangement in place.
                                This is where safety has also brought benefits in other areas beyond, being prepared for a return to business work environment when it was deemed less risky to do so. 
                                Working from home for non-essential staff, was a real game-changer both as Governments protected non-essential employees, but broader restrictions 
                                on movement, gatherings, households occupancy, bubbles, distance management and mask wearing; were also key to supporting the prevention of the mass spread 
                                of the Covid virus. This also meant, employees were still able to earn their salaries, supported by government and business efforts.
                                This one the one hand reduced the stress and uncertainty over income and protection for homeowners, whilst also reducing 
                                costs associated with attending work, like travel, food and vehicle running costs. For employees,
                                this not only took a significant amount of pressure off, commuting time and stress, but the benefited them in being able to 
                                spend time being more productive and less in stressed situations associated with commuting.
                                Beyond that, with the closure of entertainment, restaurant and re-creation facilities,
                                people have also saved money on discretionary spend, which has also contributed to overall monthly available
                                disposable income.
                                What does this all mean? Well; it depends on the household, but over 15 months, homeowners have managed to save, an average of 26%
                                of their monthly income, by working from home and, unsurprisingly, through saving money by not spending on other leisure and recreational activities.</h4>

                                <h3>2. How much did households potentially save through lockdown</h3>

                                <h4>If the average combined household income is approximately £2,400 per month, then a 26% saving per month would equate to
                                £624 per month.
                                As lockdown duration was a minimum of 16 months, we could assume household were able to make a potential total <b>saving of £9,984</b>
                                per household, over this time frame.
                                Wow! That is a lot of money, and homeowners, are noticing the accumulation of this type of saving. Beyond putting some aside for a
                                rainy day,
                                they are looking at opportunities to improve their homes, through collaborative value add build projects</h4>

                                <h3>3. New emerging trends in home development and how this means homeowners can save money</h3>

                                <h4>At <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a> our analysis shows that going forward, spend on refurbishment and development will make a come-back, 
                                over the long term, in a major way.  Projects that homeowners have put off due to finances and affordability, 
                                have become an affordable realisation, with the savings, which is really good news! Homeowners can now
                                look at cost optimised projects, which they can take on, to make these home improvement goals a reality.
                                Let's not forget, larger development, building and renovation type projects, will also make a strong recovery,
                                Homewoners will also be looking to work with expert builders on projects to improve or develop their properties. 
                                Bottom line, there is a lot of work coming, which will be stretched over the long term, and this is good news for 
                                homeowners and builders. To meet this demand, builders will need to be on standby, and be ready to cope with the pent up demand for building, renovation, 
                                and reparation project work. We move to solve by enabling communication of projects or work
                                via the platform, and builders can manage work in the simplest way.
                                Using a techonolgy platform like can grow potential revenue by > 70%, this is huge when compared to other channels which are not technology enabled. 
                                Still you may ask, how can builders and homeowners work on a project?
                                Using technology to connect in the right way, will become increasingly important, and
                                with <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a>  presenting, organising and delivering information to facilitate a collaboration project,
                                will come to define how builders and customers work together on projects. 
                                Moreover, on-going maintenance and development projects, particularly in commercial, business, office, factory and real estate. 
                                Will require a degree of Covid proofing and supports specifications requiring this.
                                The need to adapt offices, and work areas, has created a new market with adaption of existing and
                                emerging technologies to solve these and other challenges in HSE and Occupational Health related modifications at work.
                                Why is this important? This means, new health and safety directives, as well as guidelines,
                                they will need to be drafted, assessed, validated and implemented,
                                this means there may be a few more months where employees, can potentially save more money, 
                                during this process, ahead of returning to work enmasse.</h4>

                                <h3>4. Trends in residential builds</h3>

                                <h4>Working from home is largely going to continue until certain safety criteria is met in the return to
                                office arrangements,
                                and new health and safety provisions, directives are already being commnicated to staff when they 
                                look to returning to an office based work environment.
                                Without question, working from home is the safest approach employees can take to prevent them from
                                catching new strains
                                of Covid. In coastal towns like Southampton and Portsmouth, their has been a substantial increase in
                                the requirement for builders
                                to work on home renovation and development projects, driven by homeowners who own a second residence
                                and are looking to spend more time there, for two primary reasons</h4>

                                <h4>a. To escape the health risks associated with working in the city.</h4>
                                <h4>b. To better appreciate the location of their second home.


                                <h4>This has meant that coastal towns have seen an increase in the number of development and renovation
                                projects, along with an
                                increase in both property ownership and buy to let activity. This increase could indicate the start
                                of a trend for more people to own second properties
                                in coastal cities and towns, both as an escape, but also, more importantly a way for people to avoid
                                the risk of being exposed to the health risks associated
                                with working in cities, which were exacerbated by covid, and contagion is found central cities and
                                suburban areas, where the concentration of people in close proximity tends to be much higher.</h4>

                                <h3>5. Good news for builders</h3>

                                <h4>In cities like London, the increase in demand for builders has been driven by redevelopment,
                                restoration and home improvement.
                                That is not to say that the demand for new properties is down, but that existing builds also require
                                work, and this is based on the existing
                                labour force complying with covid spread prevention guidelines. In Sheffield and Birmingham, as well
                                as a shortage of properties to meet demand,
                                the government Is driving initiatives to create more commercial and financial
                                opportunities in northern cities,
                                this has garnered an increase in homeownership, as jobs migrate to, and; are created in these northern
                                cities.</h4>
  
                                <h3>6. Collaboration on build projects is on the up</h3> 

                                <h4>With homeowners having more disposable income, they may choose to spend money on high-ticket items
                                in home development and home renovation,
                                in the UK home development and renovation is a huge industry. A survey by Hiscox reported in the
                                independent suggests the number of homeowners
                                looking to home improvement stood at around 15% in 2019, up from 3% in 2013. Builders in Southampton
                                are both advising and collaborating
                                with homeowners both to help them reduce costs, but also allow homeowners to participate in
                                different types of building projects in a more hands on
                                manner. These projects range from property renovations and improvements, to installations,

                                This can be both rewarding for the homeowner as the project sponsor and stakeholder, but also
                                empower the homeowner to learn and develop new
                                skills as well as help with gaining new experiences, that are memorable and exciting.</h4>
                        
                                <h3>7. Being covid safe is how builders are building trust</h3>

                                <h4>Alvin a builder from Birmingham has noted that he has worked on several projects with customers, and
                                whilst Covid has meant he has had to change
                                some of his practices to be compliant with homeowners requests, and government guidelines, he has
                                been more than happy to adapt,
                                as this keeps both him and his customers safe, which everyone he thinks prefers. Some of the things
                                he has had to adapt to include:</h4>

                                <h4>- Working on fewer projects that require interacting with large groups of people outside of his bubble</h4>
                                <h4>- Working with homeowners to ensure he understands if there are vulnerable people in the property
                                who are shielding or isolating because of the higher risk Covid presents due to their age or health or because 
                                they have reason to believe they should be isolating due to ping on Track and Trace
                                or government guidelines given their recent activity and where their is a reasonable assessment to do so</h4>
                                <h4>- Being vaccinated to protect himself from suffering the more severe effects and treatments required
                                if he were to catch Covid</h4>
                                <h4>- Ensuring that he is wearing the right Preventative Protective Equipment (PPE) as required on each
                                job, on a case by case basis this includes face masks and the use of hand sanitisers</h4>
                                <h4>- Taking lateral flow tests after a given project, if in his reasonable assessment he deems it
                                necessary, and then determining</h4>
                                <h4>- Signing up to the government Track and Trace initiative as well</h4>

                                <h3>8. What should you consider with a build project</h3>

                                <h4>As with any project there may be more than one party that is involved, but the principle processes
                                that all builds should cover include:</h4>
            
                                <h4>- Planning and Designing</h4>
                                <h4>- Permissions</h4>
                                <h4>- Building and Development</h4>
                                <h4>- Planning for the unexpected</h4>
                                <h4>- Paperwork</h4>
                                <h4>- Materials and equipment</h4>

                                <h3>Builder's Depots</h3>

                                <h4>On the topic of materials, builders have access to a strong network of builder's merchants amd builder's depots. builder's merhcants tend to be more specialist and
                                    typically cater for commercial or specific material requirement projects. But builder's depot's are equally essential for builders and home DIY enthusiasts, as
                                    they can offer a range of materials and solutions in one large central location. The fact that the advent of online booking, ordering and collections, means 
                                    that efficiencies can be offerred by builder's depots, such that they can also support bil of material, schedulled orders from builders for projects, and subsequently bookin collections, or delivery slot, 
                                    means more flexibility and productivity solutions for builders. Projects can be supported in a JIT (Just in Time) way as well as fiancially viable for the builder, to aid cash management. 
                                    Materials are delivered in a JIY way are available when needed and not before, enabling better resource and 
                                    cashflow manegement for businesses, these are typcially  smaller or independent business, which need to hold onto cash until it is needed to be called up. 
                                    Builder's depots also have very experienced and well trained staff who support the builder trades, and as such the staff can work better and in a more agile way, with the different trades and their appraoches.</h4>

                                outset, to avoid any confusion or misunderstanding.</h4>

                            <h3>9. Planning and Designing</h3>

                            <h4>One of the first things to do is research what previous similar projects have cost
                                and how much you need to spend, this will help establish both what you can afford and 
                                what you can expect for your budget. The next step is to secure the funding this could be in the form of your own savings, 
                                leveraged debt (loan), mortgage or consortium fund, a mortgage broker can help establish what kind of funding is appropriate, 
                                and how you can access it as well as the payment schedule. Depending on the complexity you may need to bring in an 
                                architect, and/or a designer, or it may well
                                be that you can do the planning and designing yourself.
                                In which case you can save time and money, and to some extent really communicating the idea or
                                concept that you want to achieve.
                                Use the Request for Quote response from <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a> to arrange a time for your builder to
                                visit your property to determine
                                what work needs to be done, (with the architect and designer) how long it will take, what it will
                                cost, and potentially when and how you want to work. This should be documented on the RFQ, that the
                                builder has printed off and brought with him,
                                this ensures any topics discussed are summarised, costs are worked and pre=agreed, and any aspects
                                and details agreed will make their way into the final draft of the contract, which the
                                builder can complete and send back to you electronically on our platform.</h4>
                                
                            <h3>10. Permissions</h3>

                            <h4>It is essential that you apply for planning permission via your LPA or Local Planning Authority, if
                                you are either/or</h4>

                            <h4>(1) Building something new</h4>
                            <h4>(2) Making a change to the building or</h4>
                            <h4>(3) Changing the use of the building</h4>
                
                            <h4>If you do not seek planning permission and get permission for the work as per the application, you
                                risk having all the changes undone by way of being served an enforcement notice.
                                On <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a> once you are happy with the provisional quote that the builder has given
                                you, you can electronically agree to proceeding with the activity of converting the RFQ to a formal
                                quote, which is an agreement to proceed with the work. This will enable your builder to produce a clear
                                documented Quote, with anything agreed in a structured and auditable way,
                                your builder simply needs to fill in the details using the creation of quote screen, and at each
                                stage they will be able to check the detailed evolution of the quote to completion
                                to ensure that the collaboration agreement, translates into a formal document of work.</h4>
                                
                            <h3>11. Building and Development</h3>
                                
                            <h4>A lot of the work that is done to a high standard will add value to the property by way of the new
                                build.
                                This will typically add more value than the cost of the work all in, to the value of the property,
                                therefore,
                                this is a big incentive to look to build. The build should be consistent with the permission
                                received from the
                                LPA and reflect the material realisation of the plans submitted. Using <a href="https://billntrade.com" class= "billntrade">billntrade.com</a> your
                                builder should
                                be able to create clear quote for work, based on the customer requirements</h4>
                            
                            <h3>12. Planning for the unexpected</h3>
                            
                            <h4>As with any project, there will be unforeseen and unplanned things that arise. One of the best ways
                                to deal with this is the need to have a contingency budget of at least 10% of the original project
                                budget, in the event that the unforeseen arises and
                                requires that this money be reserved, for allocation to this eventuality,
                                this should not be the result of a change in scope, but in the event that anything comes up that the
                                original budget did not cover for, but is essential to ensuring the project success. This is typically
                                something that comes up when the project has started, and is a roadblock to ensuring the
                                continuation of the project. Additionally, always get the right insurance for the development or renovation. 
                                Ensure the policy complies with your development or renovation else it could be left null and void, 
                                if the policy was ever to be called upon. Ensure the builders are compliant with health and safety standards on site, 
                                which include things like tidying up, using scaffolding, dust protection etc.</h4>

                            <h3>13. Paperwork</h3> 
                            
                            <h4>This is probably one of the more important aspects of the project and includes having records of
                                quotes, invoices, work completed, costs, notes taken etc. This will help with any discussions or disputes that may arise
                                in the undertaking of the work or any issues that result before, during or after the assignment or
                                project.</h4>

                            <h3>14. Build projects work better in the summer months</h3>
                        
                            <h4>Over 80% of builders surveyed prefer to work in the summer months, on outdoor projects like
                                extensions and conversions. There is a big incentive for builders to work in better weather and this helps both with progress of
                                the project, project attendance,
                                but also, commitment to delivery on time, all this ahead of the change in the weather.</h4>
