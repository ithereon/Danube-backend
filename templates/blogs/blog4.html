                        <h2>Solar is also the key to sustainable energy supply</h2>

                        <h3>Solar is a sustainable and clean energy source</h3>

                        <h4>Ask any scientist and they will tell you the 'sun' is an incredible source of energy and
                            with the
                            right technology and connected devices it can provide one of the cleanest and most effective
                            renewable
                            sources of energy readily available. The energy available from the Sun will last sustainably longer
                            relative
                            to human needs than fossil fuels or other less clean and hard to source natural resources.
                            An interesting fact, the energy the sun releases in one hour has the capacity to meet the
                            worlds' global
                            energy demands for one year.</h4>

                        <h3>What has caused the shift in homeowners thinking about solar energy as a primary source of energy</h3>

                        <h4>As homeowners become more aware of the finite nature of fossil fuels like coal and crude oil,
                            contributes to the increase in carbon in the atmosphere and accelerate global warming and
                            climate change. In a view to leave a sustanable and hbitable planet for their children, and generations to come,
                            looking at alternative forms of sustainable and less harmful energy sources, to provide our energy needs 
                            is globally a recognised goal.</h4>
                        <h4>as well as our reduced consumption of those energy sources that are harmful.
                            In the developed world, asking if there is more that can be done to switch to using alternative natural energy
                            sources, is begin to become a high priority mandated requirement, and more prevalent as a narrative, supported by governments, media campaigns for 
                            awarneess by sustainbale energy interest groups, as well as new and existing sustainable energy providers operating in the market.</h4>

                        <h4>This is supported by a collective concern across the world, that the future of the planet as we know it is 
                            at risk if we don't move away from fossil based forms o energy, as a matter of urgency.</h4>

                        <h4>Any in-action on the part of government, economic intersts and at industrial level, will result in long term damage to 
                            the planet, hence whilst green initatives and state sponsored projects to hit emission reduction targets, need to 
                            be met, head on, and the use of natural energy sources like the sun, be mafe financially viable, available, accessible and implementable,
                            with the least of friction.</h4>

                        <h4>One of these options is solar power, the benefits of harnessing the suns energy to create a
                            renewable energy supply that can power heating and electric, is relatively low risk, high
                            benefitand an investment in the future of the planet.<h4>

                        <h4>Solar energy also offers a path to zero carbon net emissions in the supply chain, over the
                            long term,which is better for the environment and creates less dependency on the more damaging and
                            finite resources the are fossil fuels in their nature.</h4>

                        <h4>In order to support the transition to solar as a viable source of energy supply,
                            electricians are up-skilling and getting training in understanding, implementing, repairing and maintaining,
                            solar based solutions for domestic use. Not only does this enable electricians to become proficient in creating, installing,
                            supporting, servicing and repairing solar infrastructures, but it helps to future proof the path to sustainable energy supply in the 
                            future, as the expertise and knowledge can be learnt, shared and built upone.
                        </h4>

                        <h3>What is driving the change to solar<h3>

                            <h4>Cost saving</h4>

                            <h4>Historically solar energy has been considered expensive and inefficient. However,
                                that view has changed in more recent times, with the lowering of prices through
                                competitive technological developments, marketing and sales strategies as well as
                                solar panel grants, supported by govenrments</h4>

                            <h4>The UK government can help with the burden of switching costs for customers</h4>

                            <h4>There are also grants available to business as an incentive to develop solutions in
                                the solar energy space, as well as for homeowners looking to switch to solar, the grants are backed by a
                                government which is really improtant to driving innovation and solar adoption in both industry and
                                private establishments.</h4>
                            
                            <h4>Consider EU regulation, as it is an EU driven strategy</h4>

                            <h4>The Solat initiative in the EU i subject to the larger EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED)
                                which requires all member countries to set a strategy to reach a 20% renewables
                                target by 2020. Most countries are not on target to hit this and more is required to be research 
                                and understood in order to implement a recovery plan theat is deliverable</h4>

                            <h4>This directive would not apply to the UK in the wake of the UK’s departure from the
                                    EU, but the continuation of this directive will be subject to the UK government’s view
                                    on directive alignment policy cost, feasibility and a strategy shaped around an independent 
                                    renewable energy policy.</h4>

                            <h3>UK government, Let's briefly talk about grants<h3>

                                <h4>There are several structures to the grants, there is the Feed in Tariff
                                    scheme, this focuses on those estates that generate electricity by solar power or wind turbines. The estates receive an
                                    amount of money for any surplus of each unit kilowatt per hour that they return to the grid. Thou the scheme
                                    ended in 2019 in the UK, it is still available to those that registered prior to 2019. The scheme lasts for 
                                    20 years from the date of registration and is dependent on the type of technology, size of the system in place, 
                                    and when it was installed. This offers a significant period by which homeowners could make savings on energy bills,
                                    as well as contribute to the sustainable energy and planet initative, at an individual level. 
                                    Investment in solar technology is both financially and beneficial, but also allows homeoweners to 
                                    make a difference in the bid to save the planet.</h4>

                                 <h3>Installation of solar panels by sizes<h3>

                                <h4>Since the scheme closed, the Feed in Tariff has been replaced by th SEG (Smart Export Guarantee).
                                    The scheme although different at its core, focuses on small-scale low carbon electricity generators to receive payment

                                <h4> It is improtant to note, The RHI is a 7-year support programme with quarterly payments depending on the technology 
                                    being used and the latest related tariffs. One pre-requisite is the property must have a valid EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) 
                                    that must provide an assessment and demonstration of how it could be improved. </h4>

                                <h3>Alternative schemes and how they benefit the homeowner</h3>

                                <h4>Another popular scheme is the Free Solar Panel scheme, this enables those property owners who cannot 
                                    afford solar panels to rent out their roof footprint to solar panel companies, 
                                    these companies would take or the responsibility for installation, maintenance, and repair all for free, i
                                    n compensation they would receive a payment called the (FIT) Feed in Tariff, linked to EPC.
                                    
                                <h4>As well as this scheme there is the Solar Buyback Scheme. This is a scheme where a lump sum amount from the companies that 
                                    provide the energy is rebated to the homeowner for the surplus.</h4>
                            
                                <h4>With the above scheme it is important to note, that the rebate the customer would typcially receive for the
                                    surplas sold back to the company, this is offsert agoant the the cost of leasing the solar panels and managing the solar panels 
                                    by the company. The company does this by collecting the FIT rebate, which the homeowner would recieve to manage the cost offset..
                                    Homeowners need to research and understand how This scheme would work in relation to their needs, 
                                    assessing how the lump sum compares to the FIT, is one such consideration. If this scheme works for the property owner.

                                <h3>How can homeowners evaluate the benefits</h3>

                                <h4>It is also for the homeowner to determine the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy, as a guide, 
                                    advantages include, low maintenance costs, varied applications, progressive technology, reduced electric bills and a 
                                    renewable energy source. The disadvantages include weather, cloudy, overcast could all affect both the amount and the level of energy generation, 
                                    the cost for a significant roof footprint of solar panels and in-direct pollution.</h4>

                                <h3>Maintenance of solar panels - cleaning</h4>

                                <h4>In reference to Low maintenance costs this centre's mainly around keeping the panels clean, 
                                    this should be done a couple of times a year or if they are fouled for some reason. 
                                    Specialised tradespeople run cleaning companies for solar panels they can charge between £25 and £35 pounds 
                                    for the service and offer 20 to 25 year warranties.</h4>

                                <h3>Maintenance of solar panels - core units and cables</h3>

                                <h4>The inverter also know as a solar inverter or PV inverter is an electrical converter, 
                                    it takes the variable (DC) direct current output from a (PV) photovoltaic solar panel converting 
                                    it into alternating AC (alternating current) this process utility can supply a commercial electric grid, 
                                    or be used by local off-grid networks. The inverter needs to be replaced every 4 or 5 years due to 
                                    the working nature of the device, which results in wear and tear over time. Cables should also be replaced to 
                                    ensure sustained efficiency</h4>
                                        
                                <h4>Homeowners should consider, benefits of solar, after the initial outlay, and the running cost over the life of the panel, 
                                  this is typically less costly for both maintenance and repair.</h4>

                                <h3>Solar has other applications also</h3>
                
                                <h4>Solar energy can also be used in solar thermal panels to heat water; it absorbs the heat
                                    (via collectors) of the sun via a photo voltage process, takes the heat-transfer fluid (water)
                                    to the hot water cylinder, this provides your property with free heated water. PV (photovoltaic)
                                    can be used to generate electricity; this not only has domestic applications but has applications
                                    where access to power is limited or not possible from the grid, such applications include to distil
                                    water in regions with limited clean water supplies.</h4>

                                <h3>The big save with solar</h3>
                
                                <h4>With everyone looking to reduce their electric bills and big suppliers monopolizing market rates,
