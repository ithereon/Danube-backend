                        <h4>If you need a shower unit installed and plumbed, a plumber can help here. If your shower does not deliver hot water shower it may be the boiler unit that 
                            is not heating up the wates as it should do, then you may need to get a licensed plumber to look at it. 
                            Perhaps there is no water coming out of the shower. This could be a result of blockage within the shower pipes.</h4>

                        <h4>Does your shower produce screeching or yelling sounds inside the pipe anytime you use it? The sound could be caused by sediments built 
                            up within the pipes and may require deep cleaning and sometimes replacement of the pipes. Additionally, it could be that there is cold water,

                        <h4><b>Removal of trapped air or air bubbles in the plumbing apparatus</b></h4>

                        <h4>Have you noticed that water is not flowing from the taps in your home? Lack of water flow may be caused by the formation of airlocks within the pipes. 
                            The trapped air prevents the normal flow of water in the pipes, making it difficult to use the bathroom sinks, kitchen sinks, and even the hot showers.
                            These dependent systems in the structure can all be affected ny single or multiple air bubbles in the piping.</h4>

                        <h4>Professional licensed plumbers can release the trapped air from your drainage system. Since there is no way to tell whether the lack of water in the taps is a result of airlocks or 
                            blocked pipes, we recommend you get in touch with plumbing services for an inspection first.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Services for unblocking the drainage</b></h4>

                        <h4>The majority of plumbing companies in the UK offer services to unblock the drainage. Blocked drains can cause big problems in the kitchen and bathroom, 
                            including foul smells, mould, bacteria and other bacteria and hygiene  related issues. That's why care shuld

                        <h4>Additionally, flushing food debris down the kitchen sink may cause the drainage to block, making it difficult to wash dishes in the sink. 
                            Any pressure applied to the pipes of the plumbing system in your home may cause them to burst. Burst pipes cause the waste in the pipes to back up and come out of the toilet bowl or the kitchen sink. 
                            If you have witnessed any of the above in your home, you need to hire a plumber immediately to fix the drains. </h4>

                        <h4><b>Odor detection test services</b></h4>

                        <h4>One of the signs that your home may be in desperate need of plumbing services is strange funky odors around the house. Finding the source of strange odors caused by plumbing issues 
                            may be difficult since the odor may come from within the pipes.</h4>
                        
                        <h4>Plumbing companies provide odor detection tests. The tests involve the use of smoke or electronic tests to trace the source of the odor. Strange odors in your home may pose a safety threat to your home. We recommend you call in a 
                            plumbing contractor immediately to detect the source of strange odors in your home.</h4>
                        
                        <h4><b>How Is Smoke Drain Testing Done?</b></h4>

                        <h4>1. Firstly the plumber needds the right tools, equipment and resources as well as knowledge of drainage systems</h4>

                        <h4>2. They then locate the main drain line, where the waste pipe exits the property, a ballon is inserted and air inflated 
                            past the sweep, to block the drainage system. The main water stop cock must be turned off and no water allowed to flow.</h4>

                        <h4>3. The roof is accessed or the attic, and smoke is introduced. Whereever, the odur or smell is coming from it is best to start 
                            in this area, as this is the likely source, (although there may be additional sources).</h4>

                        <h4>4. The plumber will look for the smoke beginning to rise from vents, and block these off with duct tape as appropraite</h4>

                        <h4>5. The plumber will inspect the attic under crawl spaces and between beams.</h4>

                        <h4>6. The plumber will be inspecting for breaches and once identified will mark the area in question and remove any cladding 
                            to access the breach.</h4>

                        <h4>7. The plumber can then inspect and make the necessary repairs</h4>

                        <h4>The whole process can take upto several hours, and depend on the drainage system, accessability, size of property etc.
                            you can expect to pay between £500 and £4000 pounds for the whole job, but many factors affect the price, some of which we 
                            have mentioned above.</h4>

                        <h3>Sewer line replacement services</h3>

                        <h4>When we flush water down the drain, we assume it goes straight to the sewer system and disappears. However, if the sewer line for the home breaks or clogs, 
                            dirty water finds its way back into your home again. Old age and tree roots may cause the sewer pipes to break. Plumbing contractors provide sewer line repair and replacement services. If your sewer line is broken, 
                            we recommend you hire a plumber to fix it and improve the hygiene of the water in your home.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Costs and what is involved in sewer line replacement?</b></h4>

                        <h4>1. A camera line inspection is a pre-requisite in any sewer line inspection, and can identify faults using visual and digital imagery.
                            This can be to inspect what the plumber can't see, or to confirm what the plumber suspects, either way, the obhjective is inspection,
                            through visual analysis and identification of the root problem and/or secondary problems. As well as confirming potential causes. The cost 
                            of this can be anywhere between £200 and £600, and will depend on a number of factors, such as access, location, time, disruption etc.</h4>

                        <h4>The added benefit is that the process is more surgical, in that the plumber does not need to dig up the entire piping foundation, but rather,
                            can use a method to pin-point the prblem area, and focus on digging their, and rectifying the problem at source. This is cheaper than digging up 
                            and entire drainage or sewer line, as well as the work to repair and replace it.</h4>

                        <h4>In the event that it is highly localised damage, the plumebr can quote for the cheapest and most effective way to repair the damage
                            through the use of a camera. This is also less disruptive, distressing and costly for the homeowner.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Traditional</b></h4>

                        <h4>If work needs doing the two most common methods are traditional or trenchless. Traditional costs around, £100 to £200 per foot, and involves
                            digging up the old piping and replacing it with a new one. This is costly on removals of earth and aggregate, as well as 
                            clean up and restoration costs.</h4>

                        <h4><b>Trenchless</b></h4>

                            at the location. This is common if the line isn't completely broken, but split, it is also possible to aling it.</h4>

                        <h4><b>2.  Pipe Bursting:</b></h4>

                        <h4>Insertion of a new pipe which is expanded, to cause the old pipe to burst, and the new pipe replaces the localised area, 
                            and creates a uniform seal.</h4>
                        
                        <h4><b>Landscaping and clean-up</b></h4>

                        <h4><b>Leaking pipes<b></h4>

                        <h4>Leaking pipes are a common problem and should not be put off in repair, (Plumbers report customers worried about rising costs are reportedly putting this 
                            important work off) but if not resolved the other problems around the house can develop, and cost more in the long run these problems include:</h4>

                            and also to your property.</h4>

                        <h3>Running toilet</h3>

                        <h4>Running toilets waste about 200 gallons of water in a day. Can you imagine how high the water bill will be? Several 
                            things may cause running toilets</h4>

                        <h4>•	Corroded handles of the toilet</h4>

                        <h4>•   Damaged flush valves</h4>

                        <h3>Leaking faucets</h3>

                        <h4>Leaking faucets around the house can be wasteful and annoying. What causes dripping faucets? Various 
                            things could cause the faucet to leak.</h4>

                        <h4>•	Incorrect faucet installation</h4>

                        <h3>Low water pressure</h3>

                        <h4>The low water pressure within the plumbing system can make it difficult to access water in the taps and shower. Most times, low water pressure indicates an underlying problem in the plumbing system. 
                            Problems that may result in low water pressure include:</h4>

                        <h4>•	Corrosion of the water pipes</h4>
                        <h4>•	Hidden leaks around the house</h4>
                        <h4>•	Clogging of the drains</h4>
                        <h4>•	Cracked sewer lines</h4>
                        <h4>•	Clogged sewer line</h4>

                        <h4>If the water pressure in your home has been low for the past few days or weeks, 
                            you need to hire a plumber immediately to check it out.</h4>

                        <h3>Clogged drains</h3>

                        <h4>Clogged drains are among the most common plumbing issues in the UK. 
                            There are 2 types of clogged drains to look out for.</h4>

                        <h4>Single clogged drain</h4>

                        <h4>This is the type of clogged drain that has only one source. For instance, if the bathroom drain clogs, the clogging only affects the 
                            bathroom and can easily be spotted by the plumber. Substances like hair, soap, and tissues can build up in the drain over time and eventually lead to clogging.</h4>

                        <h4>Multiple clogged drains</h4>

                        <h4>The multiple clogged drains occur when more than one drain in the house clogs. If the drains in the kitchen, 
                            bathroom, and bedroom clog at once, it's a sign of multiple clogging. Have you observed such an occurrence in your
                            home? Yes? We recommend you hire a plumber immediately. Multiple clogged drains result from a sewer line issue. The plumber will help prevent the sewage from backing up into your 
                            plumbing system and contaminating the clean water you use to cook.</h4>
                        
                        <h3>Failure of the sump pump</h3>

                        <h4>The sump pump (less common in the developed world, but still important to mentions) usually fails if the unit is faulty or when affected by an external issue. Other things that might cause the sump pump to fail to 
                            work include:</h4>
                        
                        <h4>•	Clogging within the discharge pipes</h4>
                        <h4>•	Improper installation of the sump pump</h4>
                        <h4>•	Aging (the average life span of a sump pump is 10 years)</h4>
                        <h4>•	Excess water</h4>
                        <h4>•	Stuck switches</h4>

                        <h4>If you notice that the sump pump is failing, get in touch with a licensed plumber to come and check it out.</h4>

                        <h3>What should I know before hiring a plumber?</h3>

                        <h4>Now you know what types of services to expect from a plumbing company, as well as the most common plumbing problems in households. 
                            However, there are several things you need to know before you hire a plumber.</h4>

                        <h3>Licensing</h3>

                        <h4>Before you hire a plumber, you need to find out whether they are licensed and approved by the law to carry out plumbing activities in your area. Also, check whether the plumbing company has the right certificates and state insurance. These documents will prove that the plumbing company is 
                            legitimate and safe to hire.</h4>
                        
                        <h4>Whenever you hire a plumber, they have to come into your home to inspect the problem. Therefore, you need to be certain that you are bringing a trustworthy, licensed professional into your home. Ask to see the credentials of the 
                            plumbing company first.</h4>

                        <h4>In case you live in a state that does not require a plumbing company to be licensed, we recommend that you do diligent research on the plumber and check whether any complaints have been filed against them in the past. If the plumbing company is clean, 
                            go ahead and hire a plumber.</h4>
                        
                        <h3>Price</h3>

                        <h4>Before you hire a plumber in the UK, you need to first request their quotes and determine if their prices match your plumbing budget. However, be mindful of extremely low plumbing prices. 
                            The quality of the plumbing work is determined by the cost.</h4>

                        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000">Additionally, cheap plumbers provide cheap unlicensed labor and may not adhere to correct installation processes, which will require 
                            you to spend more money on the plumbing system.</p></h4>

                        <h4>We recommend you work with plumbers that charge reasonable prices for their services. Look up the average cost of plumbing services online and work with plumbers 
                            that charge similar rates.</h4>

                        <h3>Warranty</h3>

                        <h4>One important takeway, is Good plumbers will always provide you with a guarantee for their services. 
                            When choosing a plumber, check the type of warranties they offer, what the warranties cover, and how 
                            the plumber is willing to stand by their work.</h4>

                        <h4>The plumbers on Billntrade.com need to offer a warranty that is valid and really does help you as customers, understand
                            what is covered, what is not, but most important if your company is not working with you should be concerned.

                        <h3>How to find a trustworthy plumber</h3>

                        <h4>Have you ever worked with a deceptive plumber or a 'cowboy plumber', in the past did they end up charging you more than for the amount of work they did or for the quote? 
                            Or maybe you've dealt with a plumber that carried out poor installations of the plumbing systems, and you ended up looking for a new plumber the following week. This is indeed the
                            stuff of nightmares, but is very real and does happen</h4>

                        <h4>Whatever your experiences might be, you will agree that working with a trustworthy plumber is very important. How do you find a plumber you can trust? 
                            Here are some of the things you need to look for in a plumber.</h4>
                        
                        <h3>References</h3>

                        <h4>When considering a specific plumber in the UK, we recommend you ask them for their references. References are people that can vouch for the quality of work and integrity of the plumber. 
                            It could be the former clients or their business partners. It could be they demonstrate the are members of a reputable trade body,
                            like the APHC (Association of Heating and Plumbing Contractors) this is one way to ensure the are not rogue traders.</h4>

                        <h4>A plumbing company that is confident in its quality of work and relationship with other clients and businesses will have no problem giving and shoing you some 
                            of its references. If the plumber avoids the topic or refuses to provide references, do not hire them.</h4>

                        <h3>Reviews</h3>

                        <h4>Reviews are the opinions of former clients about the services of the plumber. Every reputable plumbing company in the UK has a review section. Take time to go over the reviews. What are former customers saying about the plumbing services they received? Was the plumber able to fix the plumbing issue? 
                            How long did it take the plumber to respond to urgent plumbing problems? Did the plumber complete their work on time.</h4>

                        <h4>This is the information you need to be looking for in the review section. If most of the plumber's former clients approve their services, 
                            then you will likely be pleased with the outcome of the plumber's services, too.</h4>

                        <h3>Experience</h3>

                        <h4>The amount of experience of the plumber is a significant factor to consider when looking for a trustworthy plumber. If you are looking for sewer line installation services, we recommend you hire a plumber that has worked on several sewer line installations in the past. Their experience with similar projects makes them the perfect 
                            fit for the services you need.</h4>

                        <h3>Where can I find a plumber?</h3>

                        <h4>There are sources you can use to find the most suitable plumber for your home.</h4>

                        <h4>The internet</h4>

                        <h4>Personal referrals</h4>

                        <h4>Advertisement</h4>

                        <h4>The benefit of working with a skilled plumber is that they can notice additional problems within the plumbing system that you may have missed. For instance, if the water pressure in the house is too low, 
                            it could be caused by a broken sewer line or clogged drains.</h4>

                        <h4>Plumbers are experienced and skilled.</h4>

                        <h4>Asking the right questions</h4>

                        <h4>When you find several potential plumbers that offer the services you need, we recommend that you ask the plumbers the same questions, and analyze the answers they provide.

                        <h4>•	Have they done a similar project in the past?</h4>
                        <h4>•	Does the plumbing company specialize in both installation and repair services or does it offer specific services?</h4>
                        <h4>•	What trade bodies do they belong to and can they demonstrate this</h4>
                        <h4>•	Will the plumber offer a guarantee for the work they do in your home?</h4>
